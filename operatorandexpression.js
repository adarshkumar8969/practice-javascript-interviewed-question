// basic question
// 1.What is an expression in JavaScript?

//Answer: An expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value. It can consist of variables, operators, and literals (e.g., 5 + 3, x > 10).
/* 2.What are the different types of operators in JavaScript?

Answer: JavaScript has several types of operators, including:

Arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %, **)

Assignment (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)

Comparison (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)

Logical (&&, ||, !)

Ternary (? :)

Unary (++, --, typeof, delete)

Bitwise (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>)
3.What is the difference between == and ===?

Answer: == checks for loose equality (values are compared after type coercion),
 while === checks for strict equality (values and types must be the same).
